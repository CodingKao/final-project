## Conflict Plan
1. Communicate Openly: The first step to handling conflict in a group is to encourage open communication. Everyone should feel comfortable talking openly and honestly about their thoughts and feelings on the issue.

2. Respect Each Other: It’s important to remember to respect each other’s opinions, even if you don’t agree. Everyone should feel heard and respected.

3. Find Common Ground: When it comes to resolving conflict, it’s important to look for areas of agreement. Find common ground and build on it.

4. Listen and Acknowledge: Listening and acknowledging each other’s viewpoints is key to resolving conflict. This will help each person feel heard and understood.

5. Come to a Resolution: Once everyone has had their say, it’s time to come to a resolution. Brainstorm potential solutions and agree on the best one.

6. Follow Through: Once a resolution is agreed upon, everyone should commit to following through on it. This will help ensure that the conflict is resolved and won’t resurface.
